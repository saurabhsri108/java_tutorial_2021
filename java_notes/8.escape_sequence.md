# Escape Sequence

A character with a backslash ('\') before it is called escape sequence in Java. In Java, we have around 8 escape sequence. These are there to help us perform some tricky task or formatting during our code.

Let's take an example:

```java
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello "World""); 
    } 
} 
```
In the above code, we wanted to write "World" in double quotes. But the compiler doesn't recognize it because the string ended with quotation mark before the word "World". Now, it will give compilation error.

In order to fix this, we use '\' before '"' to escape the quotation mark:
```java
public class Test { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        System.out.println("Hello \"World\""); 
    } 
} 
```

And now, this will print: Hello "World" in our console. We have escaped the ' " ' using '\'.

These are other escape sequence in Java:

| Escape Sequence |                         Description                         |
|:---------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|
|        \t       |           Inserts a tab in the text at this point.          |
|        \b       |        Inserts a backspace in the text at this point.       |
|        \n       |         Inserts a newline in the text at this point.        |
|        \r       |     Inserts a carriage return in the text at this point.    |
|        \f       |        Inserts a form feed in the text at this point.       |
|        \'       | Inserts a single quote character in the text at this point. |
|        \\       |   Inserts a backslash character in the text at this point.  |

Our use cases will mainly focus on \t, \n, \\, \', and \".
