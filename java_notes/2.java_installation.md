# Installation

## How to install Java?

In order to install Java in your system, you would need 2 things:

1. JDK (JAVA Development Kit)
2. JAVA IDE: You can use any IDE like Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ Idea Community or code editors like Sublime, VSCode, Atom or even Notepad if you are a daring person! We will however use IntelliJ Idea Community here.
