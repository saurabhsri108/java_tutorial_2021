# How Java Program Runs?

Every java program runs in two steps:

1. Compilation
2. Execution

## Compilation
During the compilation phase, the java compiler takes the .java file containing the code and converts it to .class file containing byte code. This is done using below command in cmd or terminal:
```console
$ > javac Main.java
```
## Execution
During this phase java virtual machine comes into play. It takes the generated byte code .class file and converts it to our native architecture code - windows, linux, mac, etc. Command is:
```console
$ > java Main.class
```
